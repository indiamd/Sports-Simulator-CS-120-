##Summary
This program simulates a sports game (either soccer or other). The Soccer class inherits
from the Sports class, so they have the same playGame function. When the program runs, the 
user is asked which game they would like to play. Two teams are already created with a list of 
Athletes in the main function, so the user has the choice to then view the roster. When the game
is played, a random number of points to be scored is generated, and then it randomly chooses how many
points each team scores. The player can choose to play again. The main difference between soccer and Sport
game is that the total number of points scored will be less, and the game cannot be a tie in soccer. If it 
is a tie, the game will go to penalty kicks and give the teams equal opportunities to score.
